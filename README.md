# 3D Object Detection Model for Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview
Welcome to our 3D Object Detection Model for autonomous vehicles! This project implements advanced computer vision techniques to enhance self-driving car safety through robust 3D object detection and depth estimation.

The model integrates:
- Depth estimation using DepthAnything
- 2D object detection with Detectron2
- 3D point cloud visualization
- Birds-eye-view mapping
- Integration with nuScenes dataset

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Detection**: Combines camera images and LiDAR data for comprehensive scene understanding
- **Advanced Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualizations including:
  - Depth maps
  - Bounding boxes
  - Bird's-eye view projections
  - Point cloud representations
- **Real-World Dataset**: Built on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset
- **Complete Pipeline**: End-to-end implementation from data loading to visualization

## Installation & Setup

1. Open in Google Colab
2. Download the nuScenes mini dataset
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially

## Model Components
