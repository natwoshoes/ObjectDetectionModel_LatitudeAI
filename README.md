# 3D Object Detection Model 
## Overview
Welcome to the 3D Object Detection Model for Self-Driving Cars! The objective of this project is to enhance self-driving car safety by detecting objects in 3D using advanced machine learning techniques. This project provides valuable insights into the future of autonomous vehicle technology. By the end of the project, we’ll have a model that significantly improves the safety of self-driving cars. 🚙
## Features
Object Detection: Detect different objects from an image!
Visualization: Interactive graphs and charts to visualize the data and the results of the predictions.
## Installation
Download the Jupyter notebook file under the src folder, open it in Google Colab and you're good to go!
